= About Google Address Autocomplete Feature =

The Google Places API Web Service and Place Autocomplete share a usage quota as described in the <a href="https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/usage" target="_blank">Usage Limits documentation</a> for Google Places API Web Service. These usage limits can be lifted by placing a request to google as explained in their article. The daily usage is calculated as the sum of client-side and server-side requests combined.

<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Autocomplete" target="_blank">Google Address Autocomplete</a> feature adds a text input field to your woocommerce checkout page, and monitors that field for character entries. As the user enters text, google autocomplete returns place predictions in the form of a dropdown pick list. See more details <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places-autocomplete#add_autocomplete" target="_blank">here</a>.
